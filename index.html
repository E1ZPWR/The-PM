        <h3>Kiraly</h3>
        <p>
            Kiraly was always going to be a nurse – according to her parents, her career aspirations were cemented from
            the age of four. A born-and-bred Melburnian, after school Kiraly went on to study nursing and gained her
            degree in 1995 through Australian Catholic University. Then, as many young Aussies did in the 80s and 90s,
            she took her credentials to the UK to work and gain some life experience. Over 11 years she undertook
            various nursing posts, including working with the BBC as a Travel Health nurse. She also met her Aussie
            husband. On their return to Australia in 2009, and back in Melbourne, Kiraly and her husband went through
            the IVF process – several times – before they successfully welcomed a baby girl to the family in 2011.

        <h3>Prue</h3>
        <p>
            Prue is a Geelong native and threw herself headfirst into nursing organically. The idea of working with kids
            was always there, and her year 10 work experience position in a kids’ oncology ward cemented her desire to
            become a nurse. Prue’s practical placements while finishing her degree, and in her graduating year took her
            from Swan Hill on the NSW border, to Werribee Mercy on the western outskirts of Melbourne, before she
            finally settled into a role with the emergency department back in Geelong. Emergency medicine became her
            career. Prue completed her postgraduate diploma in Critical Care – Emergency Nursing. Through her career
            transition, and two kids now aged 3 and 5, she’s still working with kids and adults in emergency medical
            care. She’s been a Parentmedic educator since 2018.

    <h3>Kiraly's Story</h3>
    <p>
        Kiraly was always going to be a nurse – according to her parents, her
        career aspirations were cemented from the age of four. A born-and-bred
        Melburnian, after school Kiraly went on to study nursing and gained her
        degree in 1995 through Australian Catholic University. Then, as many young
        Aussies did in the 80s and 90s, she took her credentials to the UK to work
        and gain some life experience. Over 11 years she undertook various nursing
        posts, including working with the BBC as a Travel Health nurse. She also
        met her Aussie husband. On their return to Australia in 2009, and back in
        Melbourne, Kiraly and her husband went through the IVF process – several
        times – before they successfully welcomed a baby girl to the family in
        2011. After the birth, with their precious bundle of joy just a few months
        old, the family moved across the country to her husband’s hometown of
        Perth. Kiraly continued as a working mum in the City of Light before the
        family returned to Melbourne in 2017. Back in Melbourne, Kiraly opted for
        some more life balance, and secured a position as a school nurse on a
        part-time basis, enabling her more time for the family. It also enabled
        her to respond to the ad for Parentmedic in 2018. Her professional
        experience as a nurse, combined with the ‘fear and dread’ of becoming a
        mum to her ‘miracle baby’, meant she was able to recognise the
        possibilities and benefits that Parentmedic could afford young mums and
        carers. Kiraly freely admits that despite her Nursing experience and
        medical knowledge, panic and fear can still override confidence, when
        dealing with a medical emergency, especially when it’s personal. This is
        behind her passion for Parentmedic education and the Parentmedic movement.
        Empowering parents and carers with confidence to deal with minor ailments
        or accidents while awaiting emergency care. The calm and confidence the
        education offers her attendees, and the light bulb moments they experience
        are what drive her. Partnering with Prue through their Parentmedic
        Victoria Business Pod (Franchise), both ladies aspire to “Helping ONE
        MILLION people access Parentmedic Community Health Programs by 2030.”
        Still working as a part-time school nurse, she and her Parentmedic
        business partner, Prue, are frequent flyers at expos and community events
        spreading the word of the Parentmedic movement. They are actively involved
        with and regularly attend the Parents, Baby and Child Expo, and have held
        events and sessions in collaboration with The Salvation Army in Ballarat,
        Catholic Care and Family Life.

    <h3>Prue's Story</h3>
    <p>
        Prue is a Geelong native and threw herself headfirst into nursing
        organically. The idea of working with kids was always there, and her year
        10 work experience position in a kids’ oncology ward cemented her desire
        to become a nurse. Prue’s practical placements while finishing her degree,
        and in her graduating year took her from Swan Hill on the NSW border, to
        Werribee Mercy on the western outskirts of Melbourne, before she finally
        settled into a role with the emergency department back in Geelong.
        Emergency medicine became her career. Prue completed her postgraduate
        diploma in Critical Care – Emergency Nursing. Through her career
        transition, and two kids now aged 3 and 5, she’s still working with kids
        and adults in emergency medical care. She’s been a Parentmedic educator
        since 2018. Her inspiration for becoming a Parentmedic educator and
        franchisee operator is derived from the almost daily occurrence of ED
        attendance by parents with children and babies, seeking reassurance
        because they are unsure of what symptoms may indicate, and/or they have
        been seeking advice from Dr Google, that effectively exacerbated their
        alarm. She’s aware that Parentmedic education can circumvent Geelong’s
        overstretched emergency departments and the lack of out of hours GPs and
        clinics. She is empathetic to the lack of fundamental first aid knowledge
        for many young mums and carers. Pragmatically though, she hopes that by
        offering increased knowledge in the fundamentals of baby and child first
        aid, educators can give parents the confidence to know when and where to
        seek medical advice, in turn assisting in alleviating some of the
        stressors on an already overstretched healthcare system. Babies and
        children are going to get unwell at some stage in their early years, and
        fevers, rashes and diarrhoea are all very common symptoms of childhood
        illnesses. As an educator, Prue hopes that the skills and fundamentals
        that Parentmedic offer, enables parents and carers to realise that for
        most children these indicators can be completely harmless, and they can be
        managed safely at home. knows that when you explain to parents the things
        they can do for common afflictions at home, their confidence, and the
        simple treatments they can apply, can prevent unnecessarily anxiety and
        fear, and in many cases that even more stressful trip to emergency. The
        busy mum of 2, when she has time, likes bush-walking, gets a bit crafty
        and loves baking. She admits she loves being busy, and the role of
        Parentmedic educator and franchisee operator aligned with her values and
        interests. Sharing her knowledge, and offering her experience to impart
        confidence and calm is her passion.
